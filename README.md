# Network-Traffic-Classification-Using-CNN
Deep Neural Network approach which predict network traffics based on Feed Forward Neural Network and 1D-Convolutional Neural Network model.
Dataset used-Andrew Mooreâ€™s Dataset which was generated in  2005
Other ML model also implemented for comparision purpose only.
